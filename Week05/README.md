# Birdie
## RW iOS Bootcamp Assigment 5

**Birdie** is a A Twitter-like demo app that allows the user to send text and image messages. It demostrate the use of tableviews with different cell types and the use of UIImagePicker controller. It also shows how to move the code for cellForRowAt into a separate viewmodel which returns the correct cell type based on the model given. I built it specifically for assigment 05 of the RW iOS Bootcamp at https://www.raywenderlich.com/10529048-ios-bootcamp.
