# Cryptly
## RW iOS Bootcamp Assigment 1

**Cryptly** is a crypto currency demo app that shows the currencies owned and hit the ones increasing and decreseasing in value. It demostrate the use of Map and Filter on arrays and changes in UI theme using observers. I built it specifically for assigment 03 of the RW iOS Bootcamp at https://www.raywenderlich.com/10529048-ios-bootcamp.
